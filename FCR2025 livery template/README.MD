FCR2025 livery template

by Dan-Andrei Cojocaru

This package contains a full set of templates in order to help you create custom textures in FCR2025. They can be imported in the game via the "Upload texture" function.

Content:

For livery and suit:
- 4 PNG files with different templates: wired transparent, wired filled, full white, and simple template
- Layered document, in XCF (GIMP) and PSD (Adobe Photoshop) formats. In this document, each individual part and template is in a different layer. Toggle their visibility on to work with them.
For helmet:
- 2 PNG files: white and wired template

- A carbon fiber base template for livery

To download, simply press the green "Code" button from the right and then scroll down to "Download ZIP". The PNG files are also available in the Discord server.

Notes:
- By default, the outlined parts are transparent in the game if left so. The filled parts from the simple template will be black if left transparent.

The outlined parts in the livery represent:
- Top-right: Team logo (labelled as FCR in the simple template)
- Middle rectangle (between halo areas): steering wheel sponsor (labelled as FCR2025 in the simple template)
- Middle: Tyre upper covers and bargeboards

- Maximum and recommended texture size is 2048x2048

- The "Specular map" layer is a reference texture. Turning it on or changing it will not have any effect on the material reflections in the game.

Best practices:
- Logo colour should not clash with black or the team colour set in the Editor
- Steering wheel sponsor will not be visible if black or gray
- You can place watermarks/other markings anywhere not covered by the template.
